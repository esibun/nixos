# This file allows you to set default values for the konapaper.sh script.
# The script searches for this file in the following order:
# 1. The user's config directory (`~/.config/konapaper/konapaper.conf`)
# 2. The directory where the script itself is located.

#
# Any command-line arguments you provide will override the settings in this file.

# POOL_ID=""


# --- Random Tag Feature ---

# This feature allows you to define a list of your favorite tags and have the
# script automatically pick a few at random to add to your search query.

# RANDOM_TAGS_LIST: A list of tags to choose from.
# Tags should be enclosed in quotes and separated by spaces.
# Example: RANDOM_TAGS_LIST=("landscape" "scenic" "sky" "clouds" "water")
